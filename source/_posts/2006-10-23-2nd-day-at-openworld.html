I'm starting to see why so many bean bags are made available - sleep deprivation seems common around here.  Quick synopsis for today...

Morning keynotes from AMD's chairman and CEO Hector de J. Ruiz, and Oracle's exec vp of server tech Chuck Rozwat.  More hype here, some of it interesting (<a href="http://oss.oracle.com/">open source integration in Oracle</a>), most of it expected.

Data Warehouse session.  Speaker from Keyrus in Toronto claims that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load" title="Extract, Transform, and Load">ETL</a> is where 90% of our time is spent.  His favorite tool is <a href="http://ibm.ascential.com/products/datastage.html">IBM's DataStage</a>, other tools for working with ETL include <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/warehouse/index.html" title="Oracle Warehouse Builder">OWB</a>, <a href="http://www.informatica.com/products/powercenter/default.htm">Informatica's PowerCenter</a>, or just PL/SQL.

Michael Dell's keynote shared Oracle's theme of integration and commonality across product lines.  The future includes energy reductions, heat reductions, virtualization, and more processor cores.

Patricia McElroy's afternoon session on Streams was a bit dry with lots of walk-outs.  What do Streams add to replication?  Notifications, rule-based actions per target, cross-platform targets (Streams can modify Sybase, MS SQL, etc).  It's push rather than pull technology...

Up next: "OTN Night at the Oasis".  Free food, drinks, and lame entertainment.
