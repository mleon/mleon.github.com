This is my first time attending OpenWorld, and I decided to try blogging about the experience as the days go by.  Today is the first day of the conference.  This amazingly large event (41,000 attendees) can seem both well organized and chaotic - depending on on how well information about the conference makes its way to you.  It's lunch time right now and I just now feel well informed about where things are located within the 4-block diameter that hosts the conference events.  Now I need to get a grip on what sessions are available for my limited registration category and which are most interesting to me.  One thing I am appreciating as I write this are the comfy bean bag chairs and wifi they have throughout the many lounge areas.  First things first though...off to lunch.
