<div class="entry-content"><blockquote>If the emerging powers decide that international rules and institutions hinder, not help, their responses in a moment of crisis [&#8230;] The emerging multipolar order [&#8230;] would be based on power politics, not rules.  [&#8230;] Why is it [&#8230;] that we buy more from the Chinese than from any other nation, but we sell more to Switzerland than to China? The answer given, implicit or explicit, is usually that &#8216;China does not play fair&#8217;.  [&#8230;] European businesses continue to complain about the red tape, arbitrary administrative interference and intellectual-property theft[&#8230;]  An EU that is serious about multilateralism must, as far as possible, use existing international organizations to defuse its economic rows with China.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122809278289767851.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122809278289767851.html</a>
