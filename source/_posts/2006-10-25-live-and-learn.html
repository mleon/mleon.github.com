 I'm almost ashamed to admit my crappy experience over the last 14 hours or so.  I wasn't allowed into the concert (after taking the bus there and all), and I missed out on dinner and drinks.  It turns out that when I first registered, I was confused for someone else with the same name as me.  So I received a lesser conference pass as a result.  So I've apparently been missing out on some "extreme" sessions, free lunches, dinners, and of course the concert. Oh well, it was only Elton John after all.

I should have realized all this when my ID had the wrong company - I just figured it was a typo or something.  And this being my first Oracle conference, I didn't really know what to expect.  I straightened everything out this morning and I now have the full conference pass with bag, literature, etc.

More product info, marketing from Oracle this morning.  Now listening to Jonathan Schwartz (Sun's CEO).  Then I'm off for drinks at Thirsty Bear to prepare for Larry Ellis' keynote.
