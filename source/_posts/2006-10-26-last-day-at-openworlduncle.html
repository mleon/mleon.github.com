No keynotes today - just sessions and goodbyes.  Lots of attendees have already gone home.

My first session this morning was supposed to be about the Oracle data pump - a newer, faster way to do imports and exports on Oracle db's.  What it turned out to be though was an hour of trying really hard to decipher what the speaker was saying.  No offense intended but the presenter had a very thick accent - Indian I think.

Next session was about upgrading to 10g.  There's a nify utility which helps simplify an upgrade, automatically dealing with lots of caveats and exceptions: DBUA (Database Upgrade Assistant).

Then two worthwhile sessions on tuning and performance for the db.  First was presented by <a href="http://mikerault.blogspot.com/">Mike Ault</a> from Quest, second came from <a href="http://www.danhotka.com">Dan Hotka</a>.  Lots of recommendations for using the V$ tables, binds, and indexes.

My final session is on geospatial data warehouses and ETL.  This one is still going but topics include Oracle Spatial, ESRI, ETL designs, and error reporting.

Goodbye OpenWorld.  San Francisco was fun with perfect weather!
