Mark Hurd kicked off the day talking about how HP is in the middle of some house cleaning as far as their internal IT goes.  They're going to fewer technologies, applications, vendors in an effort to simplify and become more efficient.  And they want to use this model for all of their partners, clients as well.

Then Oracle sr. vp talked a lot about middleware (including <a href="http://www.it-eye.nl/weblog/2006/10/24/oracle-open-world-update-6-webcenter-released/">WebCenter</a>) - Oracle products for sales, marketing, communication, etc.  E-Business Suite looks decent for use as an online ordering business solution.

I attended one session labeled "Content Management for the Enterprise" which turned out to be about "Content DB" which is meant to replace file servers and can be used for email attachments.  This is not a CMS solution from what I could tell - oh well.

Then my brain gave out and needed a break.  I went to lunch at a recommended place called Magnolia's - on Haight st. and  Masonic ave.  Took a stroll through Buena Vista Park.  Then I went through the two exhibition halls and listened to John Chamber's (Cisco's pres and CEO) talk about his vision of the future...each of us communicating in our preferred media (voice, video, email) and the recipient getting the message in their preferred media.  He  sees the network becoming more integrated with the application...

This conference has a lot to offer and not enough time to take it all in.

Tonight: Elton John in concert and hopefully more free food and drinks.
