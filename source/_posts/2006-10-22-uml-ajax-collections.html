I attended some interesting sessions today...  <a href="http://www.jeffreyjacobs.com/">Jeff Jacobs</a> gave a nuts and bolts talk on UML do's and don'ts.  He showed how UML is a key component of understanding and communicating business logic/relationships/intelligence.  He emphasized the importance of good design (UML that is correct, complete, etc). UML is what's used to generate or describe the database (ER diagrams), and the application (development code).   He mentioned some persistence tools for automatically generating some of the code - tools such as <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">hibernate</a>.  Jeff recommended <a href="http://www.sparxsystems.com.au/UML_Tutorial.htm">Sparx Systems Architect</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> with <a href="http://eclipse-plugins.2y.net/eclipse/plugins.jsp?category=UML">UML plugins</a> as tools for building UML diagrams.

I caught the tail end of David Schleis demonstrating ways Ajax can transform a web application's look and feel, as well as performance...into that of a desktop application.

<a href="http://www.stevenfeuerstein.com/">Steven Feuerstein</a> showed off his in-depth knowledge of pl/sql, and specifically his grasp of collections - giving concrete examples of how and when to use different types of collections (he prefers associative arrays for most cases).  He showed lots of ways to improve performance within pl/sql by multiple orders of magnitude - by using the PGA rather than the SGA; with collections; and using some recently added features such as 'bulk collect into' (with limits).   He's got lots of <a href="http://www.oracleplsqlprogramming.com/resources.html">resources</a> and <a href="http://www.oracleplsqlprogramming.com/downloads/demo.zip">demos</a> up and available too.  Steven used <a href="http://www.toadsoft.com/toad_oracle.htm" title="Toad for Oracle">Toad for Oracle</a> for all his examples.

Keynote by Oracle president Charles Phillips was entertaining high level hype.  An interesting concept came up about having a stable core stack (incorporating the latest Oracle buzzword: <a href="http://www.oracle.com/products/middleware/index.html">"fusion" middleware</a>) on top of which many applications can be built.  Made me think of a recent slashdot post about <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/10/17/159223&amp;from=rss">Oracle Linux</a>.  They also introduced some <a href="http://www.oracle.com/solutions/mid/ebusiness.html" title="Oracle E-Business suite">nifty wizards</a> for creating applications for a small to medium business in a matter of hours or even minutes.
