I think I need to leave Phase 3 - *clunk*…. so, if I create my reality wherever I am, I guess I better change this reality or I’m just gonna keep taking it with me into the next job. I’m now in Phase 4 which is daydreaming how fabulous each meeting and encounter will be before I get there. It’s WAY more peaceful to come to everything from that space, and if the people I meet choose to retain their old behaviours I’m not engaging.
