<div class="entry-content">To my great surprise, Larry Ellison, Oracle CEO and president, spent his hour-long keynote talking about linux.  (I have to wonder how much geeked out tech training these keynote executives need to subject themselves to in order to speak the way they do.  You can sense that they&#8217;re fish out of water, but it really is hard to tell if you don&#8217;t pay close attention.)  He targeted Redhat specifically saying how much cheaper and better the Oracle linux support would be.  Oracle went as far as to demo a 1mb download that allows for a switch from Redhat to &#8220;Unbreakable Linux 2.0&#8221; in minutes.  This is flat out war in my mind.  Oracle sees direct competition in Redhat - most likely stemming from Redhat&#8217;s recent acquisition of middleware software in the form of JBoss.  And remember just a few days ago they said they want to own the whole &#8216;stack&#8217;?  Well the &#8216;stack&#8217; does include the OS after all.  I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if this is all intended to allow for a quick, easy, and cheap acquisition of Redhat by Oracle.

One might think that attending an Oracle OpenWorld conference (the largest conference in the industry I bet) would have the effect of making one favor Oracle products.  Well, I have to admit that earlier this week I was looking at ways to incorporate some Oracle middleware and take advantage of 10g/11g db features.  After all, I came here for a reason right?  The reason was initially to learn more about Oracle Enterprise db (9i and 10g) in order to help me support, maintain, and develop these products.  I have been trying to move away from Oracle for a while and have kept running into necessary features not available from alternatives.  So I came in with an open mind: maybe Oracle&#8217;s not so bad after all; maybe they have some worthwhile products.  Now, I just have a bad feeling about all that is Oracle.

The afternoon session on &#8216;open source myths and truths&#8217; was interesting.  They showed a perspective on open source I hadn&#8217;t seen - correlating adoption levels in relation to the business requirements that exist for each type of software.  Proprietary software tends to over-develop as adoption levels off, adding features that aren&#8217;t required by the business or end user.  And open source software has historically been lacking in features to the point where it didn&#8217;t meet the business requirements - and so had low adoption as a result.  Well for certain products such as apache and linux, open source  has met the business requirements and has a very strong adoption level.  And for most other product categories, there is a strong trend moving towards higher adoption  levels and more complete feature sets.  The monkey wrench thrown into all of this is the fact that most major companies are acquiring or contributing to open source software.  In the end, the software will be excellent and free.  What we&#8217;ll pay for is added value or service that gets bundled with the software - possibly in the form of proprietary code.

Then &#8216;60 Oracle db security tips in 60 minutes&#8217; was somewhat helpful.  I need to get my hands on this presentation to get the full details on those tips.

And the &#8216;web services state of the union&#8217; largely came to the audience through Oracle-colored glasses.  But there was mention of open standards and flexibility of architecture or language.
