<blockquote><p>This year, since remembering that I create EVERYTHING in my life, I’ve gone through the following phases:</p>
<p>Phase 1 - ooh, I don’t like being around these people who want to have battles when I want cooperation and consultation… I think they need to change </p>
<p>Phase 2 - ooh, I don’t like being in this job where I have to fight battles when really I want cooperation and consultation…. I think I need to leave </p>
<p>Phase 3 - *clunk*…. so, if I create my reality wherever I am, I guess I better change this reality or I’m just gonna keep taking it with me into the next job.</p>
<p>I’m now in Phase 4 which is daydreaming how fabulous each meeting and encounter will be before I get there. It’s WAY more peaceful to come to everything from that space, and if the people I meet choose to retain their old behaviours I’m not engaging. It’s none of my business. :-)</p></blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://goodvibeblog.com/2009/06/07/habits-of-tension/">Habits of Tension?&#160;» Good Vibe Blog</a>
