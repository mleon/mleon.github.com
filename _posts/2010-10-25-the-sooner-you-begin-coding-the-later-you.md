<blockquote><p>The sooner you begin coding the later you finish.</p>
<p>A badly planned project will take three times longer than expected - a well-planned project only twice as long as expected.</p>
<p>There are no good project managers - only lucky ones.</p>
<p>Everyone asks for a strong project manager - when they get him they don&#8217;t want him.</p>
<p>Some projects finish on time in spite of project management best practices.</p>
<p>Fast - cheap - good: you can have any two.</p>
<p>The first 90% of a project takes 90% of the time the last 10% takes the other 90%.</p>
<p>If everything is going exactly to plan, something somewhere is going massively wrong.</p></blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://blog.falkayn.com/2007_02_01_archive.html">Falkayn&#8217;s Nest: Agile software, Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET, eLearning, technology, politics and marketing stuff</a>
