<div class="entry-content"><blockquote>The problem is that the majority of businesses simply have no idea what they need when certain topics come up. Or they know what they want; something that looks like X, but they have no idea what goes on behind the scenes to actually bring X to fruition. So that&#8217;s where the disconnect begins; the requirements. It&#8217;s a difficult thing to get right though so all the fault doesn&#8217;t lie with the business. Even when due diligence is done it can be difficult defining what exactly is required. Nonetheless, unless the process can be defined in regards to the business and the right tools chosen for the job the product will be mediocre at best or something the client/business simply doesn&#8217;t need. Or in your case they receive a tool that is too much for them and they don&#8217;t understand. In regards to the web and software applications; every business I believe now needs a process manager.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://advogato.org/article/976.html">Advogato: The Myth that Content Management is easy</a>
