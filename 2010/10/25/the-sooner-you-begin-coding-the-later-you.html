<meta name="description" content="The sooner you begin coding the later you finish. A badly planned project will take three times longer than expected - a well-planned project only twice as long as expected. There are no good project managers - only lucky ones. Everyone asks for a strong project manager - when they get him they don&#8217;t want him. Some projects finish on time in spite of project management best practices. Fast - cheap - good: you can have any two. The first 90% of a project takes 90% of the time the last 10% takes the other 90%. If everything is going exactly to plan, something somewhere is going massively wrong. —Falkayn’s Nest: Agile software, Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET, eLearning, technology, politics and marketing stuff" />
